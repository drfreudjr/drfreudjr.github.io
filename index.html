		<td id="content_for_research" class="content">		Trained at the University of California Santa Cruz in stimulus design, 
					data collection, statistics, scientific manuscript writing. Academic interests focused on attention, 
					saccadic eye movements, consciousness, and evolutionary approaches to human behavior. 
					Numerous articles in rigorous peer-reviewed journals and have 
					served as a reviewer for such research in multiple journals.</td> 

		<td id="content_for_technology" class="content">	Started writing code at an early age, and was a Computer Science major in college 
					before pursuing Cognitive Science more broadly. In the 1990's was front-side web developer as co-owner 
					of a small web development company. Currently proficient in HTML, CSS, and Javascript;
					my procedural C and Python are a bit rusty. Experienced with experimental 
					software such as Superlab and eye-tracking software.</td> 

		<td id="content_for_communication" class="content">	Twenty years of University teaching in Psychology including Memory and Cognition, 
					Sensation and Perception, Biological Psychology, Philosophy of Psychology, Evolutionary Psych, Research Methods, 
					Statistics, and General Psychology. My classes have ranged from small seminars to those including 100's of students.
					I enjoy public speaking - my belief is that if you're having fun speaking your audience will have fun
					listening.
